        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a golden idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival
        archaeologist René Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting seaplane. After returning to the
        United States, Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis, Egypt,
        and one of their telegrams mentions Jones' old mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis seek the Ark of the
        Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark
        first.</p>

        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>
          In 1935, Indiana Jones survives a murder attempt by Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai who has hired him to retrieve the
          remains of Emperor Nurhaci. With his young orphaned Chinese sidekick, Short Round, and the nightclub singer, Willie
          Scott, in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on a cargo aircraft, unaware that the plane is owned by Lao Che. While the three of
          them are asleep, the pilots dump the fuel and escape via parachute, leaving the plane to crash over the Himalayas. The
          three narrowly manage to survive by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft.

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>
          In 1912, 13-year-old Henry &#34;Indiana&#34; Jones, Jr., is horseback riding with his Boy Scout troop at Arches National Park in
          Utah. While scouting caves, Indiana discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden crucifix belonging to
          Francisco Vázquez de Coronado and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a
          passing circus train, leaving Indiana with a bloody cut across his chin from a bullwhip and a new phobia of snakes.
          Indiana escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a
          mysterious benefactor wearing a Panama hat. Impressed with the boy's bravery, the leader of the robbers gives Indiana
          his fedora.
